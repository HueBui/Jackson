2. Dependency Injection(DI)
	- DI is a form of IoC, where implementations are passed into
	an object through constructors/setters/service lookups.
	- An IoC container is a specific kind of DI.
	- DI is a specific kind of IoC.
3. Inversion of Control(IoC)
	- IoC means that object do not create other object on
	which they rely to do their work: Một object không tạo ra một
	object khác nếu muốn sử dụng.
	- Instead, they get the object that they need from an 
	outside source.: Nó sử dụng các object khác thông qua việc 
	sử dụng từ bên ngoài.
	Ví dụ: Một các thuộc tính của một class sẽ được truyền vào thông
	qua các hàm get/set.
4. Constructor Injection
	If a B object is used in a constructor of the class A this is then
	called constructor-injection.
	class A{
		private B b;
		public A(B b){
			this.b=b;
	}
5. Setter Injection
	If a B object is used in a setter of class A this is then called 
	setter-injection
	class A{
		private B b;
		public void setB(B b){
			this.b=b;
		}
	}
6. Plain Old Java Object(POJO)
	- Plain Old Java Object is a java object not bound by any restriction
	other than those forced by the java language specification.
	- A POJO should not have to extend prespecified class, interface, annotations.
7. Beans
	- Java Beans:
		+ Have a public default(no argument) constructor.
		+ Allows access to properties using accessor (getter and setter) method.
		+ Implement java.io.Serializable.
	- Beans:
		+ A string bean is basically an any object managed by Spring.
		+ Instantiated, configured and managed by a Spring Framework container.
		+ Spring beans are defined using configuration file, annotations or refences.
	-> Spring beans khong nhat thiet la java beans.
8. Spring Configuration.
	- XML based configuration.
	- Annotation-based configuration: java 5
	- Java-based configuration: spring 4.1.
-> Dependency injection in spring by providing a standard way of configuration
and by managing the reference to the created object.
9. Anotation-config
	- is used to activate annotations in beans already registered in the application context.
	- @Required @Autowired @PostContruct @PreDestroy @Resource
10. Anotation-scan
	- is used to scans packages to find and regiser beans withis the application context.
	- @Conponent @Repository @Controller @Service @RestController @ControllerAdvice @Configuration
11.	Stereotype Annotations
	- Markers for any class with a role within an application.
	- @Repository stereotype for persistence, DAO: CSDL.
	- @Service stereotype for service.
	- @Controller stereotype for the presentation layer(Spring MVC).
	- @Component generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
12. Spring Beans Scopes
	- Singleton: A single object instance per Spring IoC container.
	- Prototype: Unique per Request
	- Request
	- Session
	- Global Session
13. SOAP-RESTful
